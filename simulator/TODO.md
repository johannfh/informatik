# TODO

Maybe some event bus system or something for broadcasting too all sockets.
I need to send stuff like stat updates to EVERYONE so I need that.
Sharing *websocket.Conns sucks, please no!
Don't really wanna have to share the *websocket.Conn because it could cause lots of issues.
Maybe registering a callback via the server so it notifies via that callback about events...

CLEANUP please...
